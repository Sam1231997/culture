                Bokkos celebrates cultural festivals that are integral to the fabric of its society. The Mushere Chiefdom
                annually hosts the Puus Keng festival between March and May, proudly showcasing the rich Mushere
                culture. In contrast, the Ron and Kulere people do not have a central cultural festival.

                Instead, each district and community commemorates its festivals, marking the beginning of the farming
                season. Some notable examples include Nafhwai in Butura, Mudurat in Mbar, Tul in Daffo, Shegeu in
                Kamwai, Hwosh in Tangur, and Dall in Firat, among others. The Kulere Chiefdom features festivals like
                Akand and Arum, while the Ron farming community celebrates Yand and Ron festivals, respectively.

                A beloved delicacy in Bokkos is Bibal, a sumptuous dish made from red beans, palm and coconut oil,
                combined with black bene seeds. This culinary delight is commonly prepared and savored during
                festivals, weddings, coronation ceremonies, and various social gatherings. Another cherished food
                among the locals is the flour of Achia, where meat is expertly cooked and spiced with palm oil and achia
                flour.
